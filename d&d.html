              You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within
              range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow
              the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the
              target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if
              your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and
              their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one

              with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed
              takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse, a pony, a
              camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to
              be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen
              form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice)
              instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an
              Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it
              gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that
              you speak.

              Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you

              Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of Healing
              power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool,
              you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to your Paladin
              level x 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the
              pool to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the
              maximum amount remaining in your pool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, you can expend 5 Hit Points from your pool of
              Healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison
              affecting it. You can cure multiple Diseases and neutralize
              multiple Poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending Hit
              Points separately for each one.

              Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected

              elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
            </p>
            <p>
              The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types

              also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the

              The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during

              At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target
